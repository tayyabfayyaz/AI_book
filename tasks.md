## Overview

This document outlines the tasks required to completely remove the Next.js project files, leaving only the Docusaurus project.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Setup

**Goal**: Clean up the project by removing all Next.js related files and directories and moving Docusaurus files to the root.

**Independent Test Criteria**: The project directory should no longer contain any Next.js related files or folders, and the Docusaurus project should be correctly located in the root.

#### Tasks

- [x] T001 Delete `next.config.mjs`
- [x] T002 Delete `components.json`
- [x] T003 Delete `tailwind.config.ts`
- [x] T004 Delete `postcss.config.js`
- [x] T005 Delete root `tsconfig.json`
- [x] T006 Delete root `package.json`
- [x] T007 Delete root `package-lock.json`
- [x] T008 Delete directory `.next/`
- [x] T009 Delete `better-auth.db`
- [x] T010 Delete `lib/auth.ts`
- [x] T011 Delete `lib/utils.ts`
- [x] T012 Delete `public/robot.png`
- [x] T013 Delete `src/middleware.ts`
- [x] T014 Delete directory `src/app/`
- [x] T015 Delete directory `src/components/`
- [x] T016 Delete directory `src/lib/`
- [x] T017 Delete directory `src/ui-components/`
- [x] T018 Move all Docusaurus files and directories from `book/book/` to `book/`.
- [ ] T019 Handle `.gitignore` merge (manual step if conflicts exist).
- [ ] T020 Delete the now empty `book/book/` directory (if not locked).

### Phase 2: Foundational

**Goal**: Ensure the Docusaurus project is set up correctly after Next.js removal.

**Independent Test Criteria**: The Docusaurus site builds and runs without errors.

#### Tasks

- [ ] T021 Run `npm install` in the Docusaurus root directory to ensure dependencies are correctly installed.
- [ ] T022 Run Docusaurus build and start commands to verify functionality.

### Final Phase: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Goal**: Final review and verification of the Docusaurus project.

**Independent Test Criteria**: The Docusaurus site is fully functional, all links work, and there are no broken references.

#### Tasks

- [ ] T023 Review the Docusaurus site for any broken links or missing assets that might have been part of the Next.js project.

## Dependencies

No direct story dependencies as the primary goal is cleanup.

## Parallel Execution Examples

All tasks within Phase 1 (cleanup) can be executed in parallel for different file paths.

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation will focus on systematically deleting Next.js related artifacts first, followed by verification of the Docusaurus project. This ensures a clean slate for future Docusaurus development.
